Learning the Godot 4 game engine by building a simple platformer. Basically just a straight line follow of on [Heart Platformer - Godot 4 Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn0i9GYBoTY-SI3yOBZjH1kJ) by [Heart Beast](https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast), though with a few changes.
